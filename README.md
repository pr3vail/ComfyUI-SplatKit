**Build 3D Gaussian Splat training datasets from a single 360° panorama — entirely inside
ComfyUI.**

Feed it one equirectangular panorama and a prompt. You get back a **COLMAP dataset**
(`images/` + `sparse/0` + an init point cloud) that trains straight away in any COLMAP-compatible
3D Gaussian Splatting trainer. The panorama branch needs no external venv and nothing to build.

SplatKit's main output is a **dataset**, so you can train it in whichever trainer you already
like. If the optional splat backend is installed, **Train Splat (COLMAP Dataset)** can also
train the dataset into a splat inside the same graph.

## How it works

One panorama is a single viewpoint, and one viewpoint cannot constrain a 3D scene. So the pack
invents the missing viewpoints, then reconstructs a real camera solution from them:

```
panorama ─▶ MoGe depth ─▶ camera-motion control video ─▶ WAN fills the disocclusions
         ─▶ SphereSfM (classical SfM) ─▶ COLMAP dataset ─▶ your trainer
```

1. **MoGe** estimates depth for the pano and turns it into a mesh.
2. A **camera path** you draw in the graph is rendered through that mesh → an equirect control
   video plus a validity mask (the holes are the parts the pano never saw).
3. **WAN** (i2v, with the Matrix-3D pano LoRA) fills those holes with temporally coherent
   content → a real moving-camera 360° video.
4. **SphereSfM** runs classical structure-from-motion on those panoramas and writes a COLMAP
   reconstruction — real matches, poses and sparse cloud.

## Install

```
cd ComfyUI/custom_nodes
git clone https://github.com/mickmumpitz/ComfyUI-SplatKit
python_embeded\python.exe -m pip install -r ComfyUI-SplatKit/requirements.txt
```

(Non-portable install: `python -m pip install -r ComfyUI-SplatKit/requirements.txt`.) Restart
ComfyUI. Three things download on first use:

- the **MoGe** checkpoint → `ComfyUI/models/MoGe`
- the **SphereSfM** binary (`colmap_sphere`, SHA-256 verified) → `bin/`. A CUDA build of
  [SphereSfM](https://github.com/json87/SphereSfM) with everything it needs included, so
  there's no CUDA toolkit to install — see [docs/SPHERESFM.md](docs/SPHERESFM.md). The right
  build for your platform is picked automatically: **Windows** and **Linux** (NVIDIA Turing
  or newer for GPU feature matching; without an NVIDIA card it falls back to the CPU —
  slower, same result). A **macOS** build is planned; until then the SphereSfM nodes need a
  self-built binary there (`COLMAP_SPHERE_EXE`), the rest of the pack is platform-independent.
- the **RAFT** optical-flow weights, the first time HiRes Composite runs with `base_mode=wan`.

**You supply:** a WAN 2.1 i2v checkpoint, and the Matrix-3D pano LoRA converted to ComfyUI's key
convention with `tools/convert_pano_lora.py` (→ `pano_video_gen_720p_comfy.safetensors` in your
`loras` folder).

## Workflows

Ready-made graphs in `workflows/`. Start with `1` — or `0` if you don't have a panorama yet.

| Graph | What it does | Also needs |
|---|---|---|
| `0_generate_360_panorama-upscale.json` | Make the input pano. **text→pano** (Krea 2 Turbo) or **image→pano** (Qwen-Image-Edit + a 360 LoRA), both with detail-refine, a roll-180° seam fix, and an upscale tail. | `comfyui-LatLong`, `ComfyUI_essentials`, `ComfyUI_UltimateSDUpscale`, `ComfyUI-Mickmumpitz-Nodes` |
| `1_generate-dataset-hires.json` | The main graph: pano → trained-splat-ready dataset in one queue. Draw a camera path, WAN fills the fly-through, **HiRes Composite** reprojects the original pano through the same geometry (+115% detail indoors / +338% outdoors — [docs/HIRES_COMPOSITE.md](docs/HIRES_COMPOSITE.md)), and dual-res SphereSfM writes the COLMAP dataset. | — |

Everything else these graphs use is core ComfyUI. Install the right-hand packs only for the
workflows you run — the node pack itself depends on none of them.

**The prompt matters.** It must describe the *actual* scene in the panorama — a wrong prompt
visibly degrades what WAN paints into the holes.

## Nodes

Dataset nodes live under **SplatKit**. Six generator-specific nodes live under
**SplatKit/4DAnyone**, and ten shared training/sequence nodes under **SplatKit/Splatting**; see [the 4D guide](docs/4DANYONE.md).
Install the backend, install the [required models](docs/4DANYONE.md#manual-model-installation), and select them in the model loaders. The 4D nodes do not download model weights automatically.

- **Core** — `Dataset Project`, `MoGe Model Loader`, `Camera Plot Fly-Through (Geometry)`,
  `Camera Plot Scene Reference`, `Wan I2V Masked-Video Conditioning`.
- **Dataset builders** — `SphereSfM Dataset` (recommended: classical SfM → COLMAP),
  `SphereSfM Dataset (Dual-Res)`, `SphereSfM Add Camera Path`.
- **Hi-res** — `HiRes Pano Fly-Through`, `Add HiRes Views to Dataset`, `HiRes Composite`.
- **Upscaling** — `Resolve Dataset Images`, `Load Dataset Images (Ordered)`,
  `Save Upscaled Dataset`, `Save Upscaled Frames (Streaming)`.
- **Image→pano** — `Persp to ERP Warp`, `Estimate FOV`, `Switch` (workflow `0`).
- **Repair** — `Rebuild COLMAP Sparse` reassembles `sparse/0` from `_spheresfm_work/` without
  re-running SfM.

The interactive path editor (`web/camera_plot_geo.js`) lets you drag anchors on the panorama and
renders the MoGe cloud behind the path, so you can see if you're about to fly through a wall. If
the JS fails to load the node still works — the path is just a text widget.

## Getting sharp splats

A single panorama caps splat sharpness two ways; SplatKit gives you a lever for each. Both are
optional refinements on top of the base pipeline — full detail in
**[docs/HIRES_COMPOSITE.md](docs/HIRES_COMPOSITE.md)**.

- **HiRes Pano Fly-Through** renders pinhole views directly from the MoGe mesh at any resolution,
  taking colour from the untouched full-res panorama — so geometry and texture resolution are
  independent (an 8K pano lands every pixel in a 4K render). It closes disocclusions instead of
  punching them out for WAN, and emits a `splat_mask` (white = real detail, black = synthesized).
  `Add HiRes Views to Dataset` registers those renders into an existing dataset as their own
  PINHOLE cameras, pinning existing poses so the add can't disturb a dataset that already trains.
- **HiRes Composite** keeps the WAN clip but stops it repainting pixels that were never in
  question: it reprojects the original 8192×4096 pano through the same geometry and only lets WAN
  fill where geometry has no answer. Measured vs the base pipeline: eval PSNR +1.31 dB indoors /
  +2.37 dB outdoors, reconstructed detail 31.9%→57.5% and 25.4%→61.4%.

## Training the dataset

The COLMAP output is ordinary — point any 3DGS trainer at the dataset folder (`images/` +
`sparse/0`). The default output uses ordinary pinhole cameras, so no special projection support
is required.

**In ComfyUI:** connect `model_dir` from **SphereSfM Dataset** (or `dataset_dir` from **Add HiRes
Views to Dataset**) to **Train Splat (COLMAP Dataset)** under **SplatKit/Splatting**. Also connect
a **Splat Perceptual Model Loader**. The node uses the same splat backend as the 4D pipeline:
install it once with a **Splat Backend Setup** node (see [the 4D guide](docs/4DANYONE.md)). It
trains one splat seeded from the SfM point cloud. It returns a one-frame `sequence` (for Sequence
Frame, Sequence Player and Save 3D Model), a `flythrough` that replays the captured cameras, and
the `ply_path` of the finished splat. The trainer renders every view through one shared pinhole
lens. Cube faces of the hi-res pano are the same lens at a larger size, so they are resized and
kept. HiRes perspective views have their own field of view, so the node leaves them out and logs
their names. To use those views, train the dataset in an external trainer.

Two things worth knowing whatever trainer you use:

- An **equirect** dataset (`Build Equirect Dataset`) stores equirectangular cameras, so it needs
  a trainer that supports equirectangular / unscented camera projection.
- For **HiRes Composite** datasets, allow a high point/primitive cap (~3M). A low default cap
  (e.g. 1M) bottlenecks the reconstruction and hides the resolution gain.

## Rasterizer: Triton / pure-torch, no nvdiffrast

Matrix-3D's renderer imports `nvdiffrast.torch`. SplatKit ships its own API-compatible
rasterizer instead (`shim/`), so there's nothing to compile and no NVIDIA-licensed dependency.
Two backends, auto-selected per machine (override with `P2S_RASTER_BACKEND=torch|triton`):

1. **Triton** (`shim/raster_triton.py`) — in-repo GPU fast path, JIT-compiled at runtime against
   your own torch/CUDA (Linux torch bundles triton; on Windows: `pip install triton-windows`).
   Self-tested against the torch oracle on first use; any failure silently falls back.
2. **pure torch** (`shim/raster_torch.py`) — zero dependencies, runs everywhere (CPU / AMD / Mac).

The shim never delegates to a real nvdiffrast build, even if one is importable. Validated vs a
trimesh ray-cast oracle (coverage 100%, colour MAE 0.0); 49-frame fly-through at 2048×1024 on a
5090: 4.9 s torch / 2.6 s triton.

## Repo layout

```
__init__.py            re-exports the mappings from nodes/
prestartup_script.py   OpenEXR codec enable, run pre-import by ComfyUI
nodes/                 the ComfyUI layer — INPUT_TYPES, tensor unpacking, thin calls
core/                  geometry, rendering, sequence helpers and backend integration
shim/                  pure-torch / triton nvdiffrast replacement
vendored/              third-party sources: MoGe, Matrix-3D, 4DAnyone
web/                   camera path editor and sequence player
tools/                 backend installer/exporter and maintenance scripts
tests/                 rasterizer, planner and optional-backend checks
workflows/             example graphs
bin/                   installed backends and download caches (ignored by Git)
```

Only `__init__.py` and `prestartup_script.py` sit at the root — ComfyUI hard-codes both
locations. Module names inside `core/` are deliberately distinctive (`gpu_lsmr`, not `solve.py`)
because the vendored tree reaches them by bare name off the `sys.path` entry
`matrix3d_pipeline.setup_paths()` adds.
